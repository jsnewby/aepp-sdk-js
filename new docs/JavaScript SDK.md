## [Overview]

**Important:** This SDK is at an alpha stage where things easily can break. We aim to make our alpha releases as stable as possible. Nevertheless it should not be taken as production-ready. 
 
With this SDK, you can develop apps for the Ã¦ternity blockchain in JavaScript.
In particular, you can implement the following:
 
1. Communication with Chain
2. Crypto methods for working with transactions
3. Contracts
4. Naming system
5. Accounts
6. Oracles
