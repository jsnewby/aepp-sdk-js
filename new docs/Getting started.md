## Overview

## Getting access to a node
You can do it in one of the following ways:

1. Connect directly to our testnet, which is available at <http://sdk-testnet.aepps.com>.
2. Use a Docker image of the latest released version of Epoch.
This way you can run your own node and connect to the main testnet.
To do this, follow the instructions below:
* [Running an epoch node on Docker](https://github.com/aeternity/epoch/blob/master/docs/docker.md)
* [Installing an Epoch test network on Linux](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-python/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
3. Clone the GitHub repository at <https://github.com/aeternity/epoch>. 
Follow the instructions on [Installing an Epoch test network on Linux](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-sdk-python/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
